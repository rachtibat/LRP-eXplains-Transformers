    """
    Implements the identity rule (from Equation 9 of the paper:
    AttnLRP: Attention-Aware Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for Transformers)
    in a more efficient manner through the Gradient*Input framework.

    Used on element-wise non-linear functions.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    fn: callable
        The function to be called with the input.
        This function must accept a single tensor as input and return a tensor of the same shape.
    input: torch.Tensor

    Used on a tensor after the torch.matmul or the element-wise multiplication operation.

    Parameters:
    -----------
